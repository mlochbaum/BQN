<h1 id="how-to-run-bqn">How to run BQN</h1>
<p>We are currently working quickly to make <a href="https://github.com/dzaima/CBQN">CBQN</a> into the definitive offline implementation. Compilation speed (self-hosted) is good, the only significant core language feature missing is block headers and multiple bodies, and the essential system functions are there. Unless you need to start heavy number crunching right away, I recommend that you use CBQN and make system function or performance requests on Github or the BQN forums.</p>
<p>A lot of development to date has been done in dzaima/BQN and uses features (mainly headers) that aren't in CBQN yet. Scripts in this repository use <code><span class='Value'>bqn</span></code> in the <code><span class='Comment'>#!</span></code> line if self-hosted or dzaima/BQN can run them, and <code><span class='Value'>dbqn</span></code> if only dzaima/BQN works.</p>
<h3 id="self-hosted-bqn">Self-hosted BQN</h3>
<p>See the subsections below for instructions on specific implementations.</p>
<p>This version of BQN is <a href="implementation/index.html">implemented</a> mainly in BQN itself, but a host language supplies basic functionality and can also replace primitives for better performance. This also allows <a href="doc/embed.html">embedding</a>, where programs in the host language can include BQN code. It fully supports all primitives except a few cases of structural Under (<code><span class='Modifier2'>⌾</span></code>), but is still missing some advanced features: block headers and multiple body syntax, derived 1-modifiers, and block returns.</p>
<p>Support in the following languages has been implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>Javascript, in this repository. Slow (compiles at ~5kB/s) but usable.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dzaima/CBQN">C</a>, targetting high performance. Some parts are fast, some are not.</li>
<li>dzaima/BQN (<a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/bqn.bqn">bqn.bqn</a>), mainly for testing.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cannadayr/ebqn">Erlang</a>, intended for embedding. Too slow to be practical yet: minutes to compile short programs.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="javascript">Javascript</h4>
<p>The online REPL is <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/try.html">here</a>. The file <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/docs/bqn.js">docs/bqn.js</a> is zero-dependency Javascript, and can be loaded from HTML or Node.js. For command line use, call the Node.js script <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/bqn.js">bqn.js</a>, passing a file and <code><span class='Value'>•args</span></code>, or <code><span class='Function'>-</span><span class='Value'>e</span></code> to execute all remaining arguments directly and print the results. <a href="https://observablehq.com/@lsh/bqn">This notebook</a> shows how to run it in an Observable notebook.</p>
<h4 id="cbqn">CBQN</h4>
<p>C sources are kept in the <a href="https://github.com/dzaima/CBQN">CBQN</a> repository, but they also require the self-hosted bytecode to be built using <code><span class='Value'>genRuntime</span></code> in that repository. The script uses <code><span class='Value'>bqn</span></code> (whatever that is) by default, but can be run with another BQN executable: bqn.js or dzaima/BQN will work. For example, run <code><span class='Value'>$</span> <span class='Value'>path</span><span class='Function'>/BQN/</span><span class='Value'>bqn.js</span> <span class='Value'>genRuntime</span> <span class='Value'>path</span><span class='Function'>/BQN/</span></code> to bootstrap using Node.js (slow but should be under a minute even on cheap hardware). Once bootstrapped CBQN itself is the fastest option.</p>
<p>Options are configured at the top of <code><span class='Value'>src</span><span class='Function'>/</span><span class='Value'>main.c</span></code>. I uncomment <code><span class='Comment'>#define FORMATTER</span></code> to get array formatting like this site uses.</p>
<p>CBQN uses the self-hosted runtime to achieve full primitive coverage, and implements specific primitives or parts of primitives natively to speed them up. This means primitives with native support—including everything used by the compiler—are fairly fast while others are much slower.</p>
<h3 id="dzaimabqn">dzaima/BQN</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dzaima/BQN/">dzaima/BQN</a> is an implementation in Java created by modifying the existing dzaima/APL, and should be easy to run on desktop Linux and Android. It may be abandoned as dzaima is now working on CBQN. It has almost complete syntax support but incomplete primitive support: major missing functionality is dyadic Depth (<code><span class='Modifier2'>⚇</span></code>), Windows (<code><span class='Function'>↕</span></code>), and many cases of set functions (<code><span class='Function'>⊐⊒∊⍷</span></code>, mostly with rank &gt;1).</p>
<p>In this repository and elsewhere, dzaima/BQN scripts are called with <code><span class='Comment'>#! /usr/bin/env dbqn</span></code>. This requires an executable file <code><span class='Value'>dbqn</span></code> somewhere in your path with the following contents:</p>
<pre><span class='Comment'>#! /bin/bash
</span>
<span class='Value'>java</span> <span class='Function'>-</span><span class='Value'>jar</span> <span class='Function'>/</span><span class='Value'>path</span><span class='Function'>/</span><span class='Value'>to</span><span class='Function'>/</span><span class='Value'>dzaima</span><span class='Function'>/BQN/BQN</span><span class='Value'>.jar</span> <span class='String'>&quot;$@&quot;</span>
</pre>
<p>If compiled with Native Image, <code><span class='Value'>nBQN</span></code> can be used directly instead.</p>
<h4 id="dzaimareference-bqn">dzaima+reference BQN</h4>
<p>This repository contains a dzaima/BQN script <code><span class='Value'>dzref</span></code> that fills in gaps in primitive support with BQN implementations. dzaima/BQN has good enough primitive support that I now almost never use this, but it's still needed for the website generator md.bqn. The command-line arguments are a script to run and followed by the <code><span class='Value'>•args</span></code> to supply to it.</p>
<h3 id="bqn2ngn">BQN2NGN</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN2NGN">BQN2NGN</a> is a prototype implementation in Javascript build to experiment with the langauge, which is now abandoned.</p>
