<p>Notes about how BQN is or could be implemented.</p>
<p>This repository's BQN implementation is written mainly in BQN: the bytecode <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/implementation/../src/c.bqn">compiler</a> is completely self-hosted, and the majority of the runtime (<a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/implementation/../src/r0.bqn">r0</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/implementation/../src/r1.bqn">r1</a>) is written in BQN except that it is allowed to define primitives; some preprocessing (<a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/implementation/../src/pr.bqn">pr</a>) turns the primitives into identifiers.</p>
<p>The remaining part, a Virtual Machine (VM), can be implemented in any language to obtain a version of BQN running in that language. The VM used for the online REPL is the <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/implementation/../docs/bqn.js">Javascript implementation</a>, while <a href="https://github.com/dzaima/CBQN">CBQN</a> is a more advanced VM in C. There are platform-specific and generic tests in the <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/implementation/../test/">test</a> directory.</p>

<p>I held a few early forum discussions on the workings of the self-hosted compiler, but aborted these because the interactive format wasn't doing too much. I haven't yet started on non-interactive replacements.</p>
