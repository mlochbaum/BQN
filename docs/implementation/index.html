<h1 id="bqn-implementation-notes">BQN implementation notes</h1>
<p>Notes about how BQN is implemented. There's not too much here yet.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="codfns.html">Comparison to Co-dfns</a> discusses the general compilation strategy and how it compares to the only other array-based compiler.</li>
<li><a href="vm.html">The BQN virtual machine and runtime</a> describes the non-self-hosted parts of the BQN implementation, that is, everything you need to port it to a new platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have also held some forum discussions on the actual workings of the compiler, but aborted these because the interactive format wasn't doing too much. I haven't yet started on non-interactive replacements.</p>
