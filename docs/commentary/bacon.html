<p><em>In BQN, bacon is American, or side, bacon, or non-pork imitation of the same. The method described here works best with medium to thick cuts, and leaves the bacon uniformly cooked and crispy. If you prefer parts of your bacon chewy and underdone, seek help elsewhere.</em></p>
<p>Begin with a heated pan at least as wide as the length of the bacon. Prefer cast iron. Cook somewhat hotter than medium, but in order to avoid sticking, don't let the pan reach full heat before starting. However, there is never any need to lubricate the pan, as grease from the cooking bacon will soon serve this purpose.</p>
<p>Use metal tongs to hold and move strips of bacon during cooking. Lay three strips of bacon parallel in the center of the pan, and after a minute or two place three at a right angle to these, on top of them. After another few minutes, flip the first strips from the bottom. This is accomplished by pulling each one out from under the top strips by the end, then setting it back on top upside-down with that end on the opposite side of the pan. For more even cooking you might also rotate (<code><span class='Number'>1</span><span class='Modifier2'>⊸</span><span class='Function'>⌽</span></code>) the three strips, so that the center one ends up on one side and one of the side strips ends up in the faster-cooking center.</p>
<p>Now allow the strips at the bottom (initially placed at the top) a few minutes to cook before flipping them back to the top. Repeat this procedure several times. This technique becomes more difficult as the bacon cooks and becomes less smooth, but this coincides with the strips shrinking so it becomes less necessary as well. For the final steps of cooking they can typically all be placed side by side. When exactly they are removed is a matter of taste; they should have attained some shade of brown but not be burned black. Removed bacon should be placed on a plate with paper towels above and below the bacon to absorb grease.</p>
<p>One or more packs can be cooked in this way. For later strips—after the first two sets of six, probably—it's less important to layer and frequently flip the bacon as accumulated grease will distribute heat better. Periodically drain grease if you are cooking large amounts of bacon. Grease can damage or block plumbing, so get rid of it in the trash rather than down the sink. One method is to carefully pour grease into a cup, refrigerate it to solidify it, and then dump it in the trash bag.</p>
<p>After cooking bacon, the residue in the pan makes it highly suitable for making scrambled eggs. In this case it's best to empty the bacon grease incompletely, leaving a thin layer to keep the eggs from sticking. Consider folding in spices such as black pepper, chili powder, or cumin: mix them with salt separately from the eggs, then pour into the eggs shortly after adding them to the pan. This allows them to mix partially with the eggs as they are scrambled.</p>
