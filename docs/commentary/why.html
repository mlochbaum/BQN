<h1 id="why-use-bqn"><a class="header" href="#why-use-bqn">Why use BQN?</a></h1>
<p>There are plenty of clean, modern languages out there, and a good number of array languages. I don't think any other language fits both descriptions quite so well as BQN, and I find the combination lets me write powerful and reliable programs quickly. What you find in the language will depend on your background.</p>
<p>If you haven't yet used an array language, BQN will present you with new ways of thinking that can streamline the way you work with data and algorithms. There's no denying that array programming has begun to creep into the mainstream, and you might be wondering if BQN has anything to offer when you can hack reduces and filters with the best of them. It does: real array programming is different in character, with more and better array operations on immutable multidimensional arrays, and syntax better suited to them. Performance that resembles a low-level compiled language more than a high-level dynamic one. Primitives flow together and compose better—one aspect that sets BQN apart from other array languages is a set of combinators that's more intuitive than previous attempts. I also happen to think BQN's <a href="../tutorial/expression.html#character-arithmetic">character arithmetic</a> system would improve just about any language.</p>
<p>If your favorite language is J, you are missing out even more! Array programmers never seem willing to accept that good ideas can come from people other than Iverson and that legends like John McCarthy and Barbara Liskov advanced human knowledge of how to express computation. They did, and being able to casually pass around first-class functions and mutable closures, with namespaces keeping everything organized, is a huge quality of life improvement. Writing APL again is claustrophobic, the syntax worries and constraints in functionality suddenly rushing back. BQN's mutable objects make methods such as graph algorithms that just don't have a good array implementation (no, your O(n³) matrix method doesn't scale) possible, even natural. With bytecode compilation and NaN-boxing, a natural fit for the based array model, it evaluates that scalar code many times faster than APL or J. The Unix-oriented scripting system stretches seamlessly from quick sketch to multi-file program.</p>
<p>BQN has no intention of being the last word in programming, but could be a practical and elegant tool in your kit—even if only used to inform your use of another language. Give it a try!</p>
<h2 id="versus-apl-and-j"><a class="header" href="#versus-apl-and-j">Versus APL and J</a></h2>
<p>Here are some more specific comparisons against the two most similar languages to BQN. I'll try to bring up the areas where BQN can be considered worse, but my focus here is definitely on BQN's strong points—I'm not trying to offer an unbiased account.</p>
<p>BQN is more like APL, but adopts some of the developments made by J as well. However, it's much simpler than both, with fewer and less overloaded primitives as well as less special syntax (J has fewer syntactic rules, but more special cases handled during execution that I think <em>should</em> have been implemented with syntax).</p>
<p>The major differences are listed on <a href="../index.html#whats-the-language-like">the front page</a> (&quot;But it's redesigned…&quot;): <a href="../doc/based.html">based arrays</a>, <a href="../doc/arrayrepr.html">list notation</a>, <a href="../doc/context.html">context-free grammar</a> and <a href="../doc/functional.html">first-class functions</a>, <a href="../doc/primitive.html">reworked primitives</a>, and dedicated <a href="../doc/namespace.html">namespace syntax</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to these, BQN's <a href="../doc/block.html">block system</a> extends APL dfns with headers, adding some very useful functionality: the header specifies block type and argument names, and also allows for simple pattern matching when used with multiple block bodies.</p>
<p>Since this section gets into the details, it's worth highlighting stranding, a feature I think of as an obvious improvement but that many BQN newcomers see as an obvious sign that I don't know what I'm doing! My full argument for this decision is <a href="../doc/arrayrepr.html#why-not-whitespace">here</a>; the two key points are that stranding is a source of ambiguity that can strike at any time, requiring a correction with <code><span class='Function'>⊢</span></code> or <code><span class='Value'>]</span></code>, and that typing <code><span class='Ligature'>‿</span></code> is really not hard I promise.</p>
<p>BQN's heavier-weight <code><span class='Bracket'>⟨⟩</span></code> syntax for lists also has its own advantages, because it can be formatted nicely across multiple lines, and also allows functions and modifiers to be used easily as elements. Being able to easily map over a list of functions is surprisingly useful!</p>
<p>BQN has no built-in control structures, which can be quite an adjustment coming from certain styles of APL or J. The <a href="../doc/control.html">control structures</a> page gives some ways to write in a more imperative style, but it's definitely not the same.</p>
<p>Primitives in BQN are pure functions that don't depend on interpreter settings. The following kinds of interpreter state don't apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>The index origin is 0.</li>
<li>APL and J use approximate comparison in primitives, controlled by a value called the comparison tolerance (<code><span class='Value'>⎕</span><span class='Function'>CT</span></code> in APL). The choice of which primitives use it and how is kind of arbitrary, and a nonzero comparison tolerance can lead to confusion, bugs, and unavoidable performance problems in some primitives. Nonetheless, I planned to add tolerant comparison to BQN—until I realized that after a year spent programming in BQN I'd hardly noticed its absence, and no one had asked for it either.</li>
<li>Random number generation isn't a primitive, but instead uses the global generator <code><span class='Value'>•rand</span></code> or an initialized generator <code><span class='Function'>•MakeRand</span></code>. This makes managing independent generators easier, and with namespaces <a href="../spec/system.html#random-generation">you get</a> several convenient functions for different use cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some factors specific to APL or J are given in the sections below.</p>
<h3 id="apl"><a class="header" href="#apl">APL</a></h3>
<p><em>See also the <a href="../doc/fromDyalog.html">BQN-Dyalog APL dictionary</a>. I compare to Dyalog here as it's the most widely used dialect.</em></p>
<p>BQN cleans up some awkward syntax left over from when each APL operator was special: the outer product is written <code><span class='Function'>Fn</span><span class='Modifier'>⌜</span></code> rather than <code><span class='Modifier2'>∘</span><span class='Value'>.fn</span></code>, and reduction <code><span class='Function'>Fn</span><span class='Modifier'>´</span> <span class='Value'>arr</span></code> is separated from compress <code><span class='Value'>b</span><span class='Function'>/</span><span class='Value'>arr</span></code> instead of <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Function-operator_overloading">overloading</a>.</p>
<p>BQN adopts <a href="../doc/leading.html">leading axis theory</a> as developed in SHARP APL and applied in A+ and J. With this it can collapse APL pairs such as <code><span class='Function'>⌽</span><span class='Value'>⊖</span></code> and <code><span class='Function'>/</span><span class='Value'>⌿</span></code> to one primitive each, and remove APL's complicated function axis (such as <code><span class='Function'>⌽</span><span class='Value'>[</span><span class='Number'>2</span><span class='Value'>]</span></code>) mechanism. The Rank modifier <code><span class='Modifier2'>⎉</span></code> then applies these primitives to non-leading axes. While this method is required in J and also favored by many users of Dyalog APL, it definitely doesn't enjoy universal support—it can be harder to learn, and less convenient for some common cases. Summing rows with <code><span class='Function'>+/</span></code> in APL is quite convenient, and BQN's <code><span class='Function'>+</span><span class='Modifier'>˝</span><span class='Modifier2'>⎉</span><span class='Number'>1</span></code>, or <code><span class='Function'>+</span><span class='Modifier'>˝˘</span></code> for matrices, just aren't as nice.</p>
<p>Arguably BQN cuts down the set of primitives too much. Base conversion <code><span class='Value'>⊥⊤</span></code>, partitioning <code><span class='Value'>⊂⊆</span></code>, and matrix division <code><span class='Value'>⌹</span></code> are commonly asked-for primitives, but they don't match <a href="primitive.html">my conception</a> of a primitive. And while each can be implemented (with short snippets, other than <code><span class='Value'>⌹</span></code> which requires a library), there's definitely a convenience loss. But there's always <a href="../doc/rebqn.html">ReBQN</a>…</p>
<p>BQN's Power modifier <code><span class='Modifier2'>⍟</span></code> allows an array operand to specify multiple results, for example <code><span class='Function'>Fn</span><span class='Modifier2'>⍟</span><span class='Paren'>(</span><span class='Function'>↕</span><span class='Number'>4</span><span class='Paren'>)</span></code> to get 0 up to 3 iterations. Intermediate results are saved, so the number of calls only depends on the highest iteration number present. On the other hand, BQN has no direct equivalent of Power Limit <code><span class='Value'>⍣</span><span class='Function'>≡</span></code>, requiring it to be <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/bqncrate/?q=power%20limit">implemented manually</a>.</p>
<p>An APL selective assignment <code><span class='Value'>arr[</span><span class='Number'>2</span> <span class='Number'>3</span><span class='Value'>]</span><span class='Function'>+</span><span class='Gets'>←</span><span class='Number'>1</span></code> should usually be written with Under in BQN: <code><span class='Number'>1</span><span class='Modifier2'>⊸</span><span class='Function'>+</span><span class='Modifier2'>⌾</span><span class='Paren'>(</span><span class='Number'>2</span><span class='Ligature'>‿</span><span class='Number'>3</span><span class='Modifier2'>⊸</span><span class='Function'>⊏</span><span class='Paren'>)</span><span class='Value'>arr</span></code> (but the correspondence might not always be so direct). You can think of this as a very fancy At (<code><span class='String'>@</span></code>) operator, that lets you pull out an arbitrary part of an array.</p>
<p>Dfns are adjusted in a few ways that make them more useful for general-purpose programming. A BQN block always runs to the last statement, so a block like <code><span class='Brace'>{</span><span class='Function'>Update</span> <span class='Value'>𝕩</span> <span class='Separator'>⋄</span> <span class='Number'>1</span><span class='Function'>+</span><span class='Value'>x</span><span class='Brace'>}</span></code> won't return early. Writing modification with <code><span class='Gets'>↩</span></code> makes it clearer which variable's which. Dfns also do a weird shadowing thing where <code><span class='Value'>a</span><span class='Gets'>←</span><span class='Number'>1</span><span class='Separator'>⋄</span><span class='Value'>a</span><span class='Gets'>←</span><span class='Number'>2</span></code> makes two different variables; in BQN this is an error because the second should use <code><span class='Gets'>↩</span></code>. Tradfns are removed entirely, along with control structures.</p>
<p>BQN doesn't have an exact replacement for dfn guards, although the predicate <code><span class='Head'>?</span></code> can look similar: <code><span class='Brace'>{</span><span class='Number'>2</span><span class='Function'>|</span><span class='Value'>⍵</span> <span class='Head'>:</span> <span class='Number'>1</span><span class='Function'>+</span><span class='Number'>3</span><span class='Function'>×</span><span class='Value'>⍵</span> <span class='Separator'>⋄</span> <span class='Value'>⍵</span><span class='Function'>÷</span><span class='Number'>2</span><span class='Brace'>}</span></code> is equivalent to <code><span class='Brace'>{</span><span class='Number'>2</span><span class='Function'>|</span><span class='Value'>𝕩</span> <span class='Head'>?</span> <span class='Number'>1</span><span class='Function'>+</span><span class='Number'>3</span><span class='Function'>×</span><span class='Value'>𝕩</span> <span class='Head'>;</span> <span class='Value'>𝕩</span><span class='Function'>÷</span><span class='Number'>2</span><span class='Brace'>}</span></code>. But note that where APL uses the statement separator <code><span class='Separator'>⋄</span></code>, BQN uses the body separator <code><span class='Head'>;</span></code>. This means that the if-true branch in BQN can consist of multiple statements (including additional predicates), but also that the if-false branch can't access variables defined in or before the condition. In both cases the &quot;better&quot; behavior can be obtained with an extra set of braces and possibly assigning names to arguments <code><span class='Value'>⍵</span></code>/<code><span class='Value'>𝕩</span></code>. I think guards end up being cleaner when they work, and predicates are more versatile.</p>
<p>BQN's namespaces have a dedicated syntax, are <em>much</em> easier to create than Dyalog namespaces, and have better performance. I use them all the time, and they feel like a natural part of the language.</p>
<h3 id="j"><a class="header" href="#j">J</a></h3>
<p><em>See also the <a href="../doc/fromJ.html">BQN-J dictionary</a>. J is under development again and a moving target. I stopped using it completely shortly after starting work on BQN in 2020, and while I try to keep up to date on language changes, some remarks here might not fit with the experience you'd get starting with J today.</em></p>
<p>To me building with J feels like making a tower out of wood and nails by hand: J itself is reliable but I soon don't trust what I'm standing on. J projects start to feel hacky when I have multiple files, locales, or a bit of global state. With BQN I begin to worry about maintainability only when I have enough functions that I can't remember what arguments they expect, and with lexically-scoped variables I simply don't use global state. If you don't reach this scale (in particular, if you use J as a calculator or spreadsheet substitute) you won't feel these concerns, and will have less to gain by moving to BQN. And if you go beyond, you'd need to augment your programs with rigorous documentation and testing in either language.</p>
<p>The biggest difference could be in file loading. If you write a script that depends on other files, and want it to work regardless of the directory it's called from, you need to deal with this. In J, <code><span class='Function'>&gt;</span><span class='Brace'>{</span><span class='Head'>:</span><span class='Number'>4</span><span class='Function'>!</span><span class='Head'>:</span><span class='Number'>3</span> <span class='String'>''</span></code> gives the name of the most recently loaded script (the current one, if you put it before any imports), but to make it into a utility you need this glob of what's-going-on:</p>
<pre><span class='Value'>cur_script</span> <span class='Function'>=</span><span class='Head'>:</span> <span class='Brace'>{{</span><span class='Paren'>(</span><span class='Number'>4</span><span class='Function'>!</span><span class='Head'>:</span><span class='Number'>3</span><span class='Value'>$</span><span class='Number'>0</span><span class='Paren'>)</span> <span class='Brace'>{</span><span class='Head'>::</span><span class='Value'>~</span> <span class='Number'>4</span><span class='Function'>!</span><span class='Head'>:</span><span class='Number'>4</span><span class='Function'>&lt;</span><span class='String'>'y'</span><span class='Brace'>}}</span>
</pre>
<p>In BQN it's <code><span class='Value'>•path</span></code>. And usually you don't need it because <code><span class='Function'>•Import</span></code> resolves paths relative to the file containing it.</p>
<p>J uses numeric codes; BQN uses mostly names. So J's <code><span class='Number'>1</span><span class='Value'>&amp;o.</span></code> is BQN's <code><span class='Value'>•math.</span><span class='Function'>Sin</span></code>, and <code><span class='Number'>6</span><span class='Function'>!</span><span class='Head'>:</span><span class='Number'>9</span></code> corresponds to BQN's <code><span class='Function'>•MonoTime</span></code>.</p>
<p>J uses bytestrings by default, making Unicode handling a significant difficulty (<a href="https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/Vocabulary/uco">see</a> <code><span class='Value'>u</span><span class='Head'>:</span></code>). BQN strings are lists of codepoints, so you don't have to worry about how they're encoded or fight to avoid splitting up UTF-8 bytes that need to go together.</p>
<p>But J has its type advantages as well. I miss complex number support in BQN, as it's an optional extension that we haven't yet implemented. And BQN has a hard rule that only one numeric type is exposed to the programmer, which means high-precision integers and rationals aren't allowed at all for a float-based implementation. I think this rule is worth it because J's implicit type conversion is hard to predict and an unexpected numeric type can cause sporadic or subtle program errors.</p>
<p>BQN uses a modifier <code><span class='Modifier2'>⟜</span></code> for J's hook, adding <code><span class='Modifier2'>⊸</span></code> for a reversed version (which I use nearly twice as often). This frees up the 2-train, which is made equivalent to Atop (<code><span class='Modifier2'>∘</span></code>). It's the system Roger Hui came to advocate, since he argued in favor of a hook conjunction <a href="https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/Essays/Hook_Conjunction%3F">here</a> and made 2-train an Atop when he brought it to Dyalog APL. As an example, the J hook <code><span class='Paren'>(</span><span class='Comment'>#~0&amp;&lt;:)</span></code> to remove negative numbers becomes <code><span class='Number'>0</span><span class='Modifier2'>⊸</span><span class='Function'>≤</span><span class='Modifier2'>⊸</span><span class='Function'>/</span></code> in BQN. Hooks are also the topic of <a href="https://www.arraycast.com/episodes/episode17-tacit4-the-dyadic-hook">Array Cast episode 14</a>, where the panel points out that in J, adding a verb at the far left of a dyadic train changes the rest of the train from dyadic to monadic or vice-versa, an effect that doesn't happen in BQN.</p>
<p>J locales are not first-class values, and BQN namespaces are. I think BQN's namespaces are a lot more convenient to construct, although it is lacking an inheritance mechanism (but J's path system can become confusing quickly). More importantly, BQN namespaces (and closures) are garbage collected. J locales leak unless manually freed by the programmer. More generally, J has no mutable data at all, and to simulate it properly you'd have to write your own tracing garbage collection as the J interpreter doesn't have any. I discussed this issue some in <a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/pipermail/programming/2021-April/058006.html">this J forum thread</a>.</p>
<p>In J, each function has a built-in rank attribute: for example the ranks of <code><span class='Function'>+</span></code> are <code><span class='Number'>0</span> <span class='Number'>0</span> <span class='Number'>0</span></code>. This rank is accessed by the &quot;close&quot; compositions <code><span class='String'>@</span></code>, <code><span class='Value'>&amp;</span></code>, and <code><span class='Value'>&amp;.</span></code>. Choosing the shorter form for the close compositions—for example <code><span class='String'>@</span></code> rather than <code><span class='String'>@</span><span class='Head'>:</span></code>—is often considered a mistake within the J community. And function ranks are unreliable: consider that the ranks of <code><span class='Value'>]</span><span class='String'>@</span><span class='Head'>:</span><span class='Function'>+</span></code>, a function that always has the same result as <code><span class='Function'>+</span></code>, are <code><span class='Modifier2'>_</span> <span class='Modifier2'>_</span> <span class='Modifier2'>_</span></code>. In BQN there aren't any close compositions at all, and no function ranks. J's <code><span class='Value'>&amp;.</span><span class='Function'>&gt;</span></code> is simply <code><span class='Modifier'>¨</span></code>, and other close compositions, in my opinion, just aren't needed.</p>
<p>J has several adverbs (key, prefix, infix, outfix…) to slice up an argument in various ways and apply a verb to those parts. In BQN, I rejected this approach: there are 1-modifiers for basic iteration patterns, and functions such as <a href="../doc/group.html">Group</a> (<code><span class='Function'>⊔</span></code>) that do the slicing but don't apply anything. So <code><span class='Function'>&lt;/</span><span class='Value'>.~a</span></code> is <code><span class='Function'>⊐</span><span class='Modifier2'>⊸</span><span class='Function'>⊔</span><span class='Value'>a</span></code>, but <code><span class='Value'>fn</span><span class='Function'>/</span><span class='Value'>.~a</span></code> is <code><span class='Function'>&gt;Fn</span><span class='Modifier'>¨</span><span class='Function'>⊐</span><span class='Modifier2'>⊸</span><span class='Function'>⊔</span><span class='Value'>a</span></code> (I also reject J's implicit merge except for the Rank modifier, as I don't think function results should be homogeneous by default). BQN's approach composes better, and is more predictable from a performance perspective.</p>
<p>Gerunds are J's answer to BQN's first-class functions. For example J's <code><span class='Paren'>(</span><span class='Value'>%&amp;</span><span class='Number'>2</span><span class='Paren'>)</span><span class='Modifier'>`</span><span class='Paren'>(</span><span class='Number'>1</span><span class='Function'>+</span><span class='Number'>3</span><span class='Value'>*]</span><span class='Paren'>)</span><span class='String'>@</span><span class='Value'>.</span><span class='Paren'>(</span><span class='Number'>2</span><span class='Value'>&amp;</span><span class='Function'>|</span><span class='Paren'>)</span></code> would be written <code><span class='Number'>2</span><span class='Modifier2'>⊸</span><span class='Function'>|</span><span class='Modifier2'>◶</span><span class='Bracket'>⟨</span><span class='Function'>÷</span><span class='Modifier2'>⟜</span><span class='Number'>2</span><span class='Separator'>,</span><span class='Number'>1</span><span class='Function'>+</span><span class='Number'>3</span><span class='Function'>×⊢</span><span class='Bracket'>⟩</span></code> with a list of functions. I think lists of functions are a big improvement, since there's no need to convert between gerund and function, and no worries about arrays that just happen to be valid gerunds (worried about losing the ability to construct gerunds? Constructing tacit functions in BQN is much easier). The usability gap widens because passing J functions around either as values or gerunds has presents some highly idiosyncratic challenges, discussed below.</p>
<h4 id="named-functions"><a class="header" href="#named-functions">Named functions</a></h4>
<p>Its impact on the programmer is smaller than a lot of the issues above, but this section describes a behavior that I find pretty hard to justify. What does the identifier <code><span class='Value'>fn</span></code> indicate in a J expression? The value of <code><span class='Value'>fn</span></code> in the current scope, one might suppose. Nope—only if the value is a noun. Let's make it a function.</p>
<pre>   <span class='Value'>fn</span> <span class='Function'>=</span><span class='Head'>:</span> <span class='Function'>-</span>
   <span class='Value'>fn</span><span class='Modifier'>`</span><span class='Function'>-</span>
<span class='Value'>┌──┬─┐</span>
<span class='Value'>│fn│</span><span class='Function'>-</span><span class='Value'>│</span>
<span class='Value'>└──┴─┘</span>
</pre>
<p>The tie adverb <code><span class='Modifier'>`</span></code> makes gerund representations of both operands and places them in a list. It returns <code><span class='String'>'</span><span class='Value'>fn</span><span class='String'>'</span><span class='Head'>;</span><span class='Separator'>,</span><span class='String'>'-'</span></code> here: two different strings for what we'd think of as the same function. But it's just being honest. The value of <code><span class='Value'>fn</span></code> really is more like a name than the primitive <code><span class='Function'>-</span></code>. To see this we can pass it in to an adverb that defines its own local, totally separate copy of <code><span class='Value'>fn</span></code>.</p>
<pre>   <span class='Value'>fn</span><span class='Brace'>{{</span><span class='Value'>u</span> <span class='Number'>3</span><span class='Brace'>}}</span>
<span class='Modifier'>_3</span>
   <span class='Value'>fn</span><span class='Brace'>{{</span>
     <span class='Value'>fn</span> <span class='Function'>=</span><span class='Value'>.</span> <span class='Value'>%</span>  <span class='Function'>NB</span><span class='Value'>.</span> <span class='Value'>local</span> <span class='Value'>assignment</span>
     <span class='Value'>u</span> <span class='Number'>3</span>
   <span class='Brace'>}}</span>
<span class='Number'>0.333333</span>
</pre>
<p>That's right, it is not safe to use <code><span class='Value'>fn</span></code> as an operand! Instead you're expected to write <code><span class='Value'>fn</span> <span class='Value'>f.</span></code>, where <code><span class='Value'>f.</span></code> (<a href="https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/Vocabulary/fdot">fix</a>) is a primitive that recursively expands all the names. Okay, but if you didn't have these weird name wrappers everywhere you wouldn't have to expand them. Why?</p>
<pre>   <span class='Value'>a</span> <span class='Function'>=</span><span class='Head'>:</span> <span class='Number'>3</span> <span class='Function'>+</span> <span class='Value'>b</span>
   <span class='Value'>b</span> <span class='Function'>=</span><span class='Head'>:</span> <span class='Value'>a^</span><span class='Head'>:</span><span class='Paren'>(</span><span class='Number'>10</span><span class='Value'>&amp;</span><span class='Function'>&lt;</span><span class='Paren'>)</span> <span class='String'>@</span><span class='Head'>:</span> <span class='Function'>-</span><span class='Head'>:</span>
   <span class='Value'>b</span> <span class='Number'>100</span>
<span class='Number'>15.25</span>
</pre>
<p>This feature allows tacit recursion and mutual recursion. You can't do this in BQN, because <code><span class='Function'>A</span> <span class='Gets'>←</span> <span class='Number'>3</span> <span class='Function'>+</span> <span class='Function'>B</span></code> with no <code><span class='Function'>B</span></code> defined is a reference to an undefined identifier. You have to use <code><span class='Brace'>{</span><span class='Function'>B</span><span class='Value'>𝕩</span><span class='Brace'>}</span></code> instead. So this is actually kind of nice. 'Cept it's broken:</p>
<pre>   <span class='Value'>b</span> <span class='Value'>f.</span>  <span class='Function'>NB</span><span class='Value'>.</span> <span class='Value'>impossible</span> <span class='Value'>to</span> <span class='Value'>fix</span> <span class='Value'>all</span> <span class='Value'>the</span> <span class='Value'>way</span>

<p>A tacit-recursive function can't be called unless its definition is visible, period. We gained the ability to do this cool tacit recursion thing, and all it cost us was… the ability to reliably use functions as values at all, which should be one of the things tacit programming is <em>good</em> for.</p>
<p>It gets worse.</p>
<pre>   <span class='Value'>g</span> <span class='Function'>=</span><span class='Head'>:</span> <span class='Function'>-</span>
   <span class='Value'>f</span> <span class='Function'>=</span><span class='Head'>:</span> <span class='Value'>g</span>
   <span class='Value'>g</span> <span class='Function'>=</span><span class='Head'>:</span> <span class='Function'>|</span><span class='Value'>.</span>

<p>This should not be possible. <code><span class='Value'>f</span></code> here doesn't behave like <code><span class='Function'>+</span></code>, or quite like <code><span class='Function'>|</span><span class='Value'>.</span></code>: in fact there is no function that does what <code><span class='Value'>f</span></code> does. The result of <code><span class='Value'>f</span></code> depends on the entire argument, but <code><span class='Function'>&lt;</span><span class='String'>@</span><span class='Value'>f</span></code> encloses rank 0 components! How long would it take you to debug an issue like this? It's rare, but I've run into it in my own code and seen similar reports on the forums.</p>
<p>The cause is that the value of <code><span class='Value'>f</span></code> here—a named <code><span class='Value'>g</span></code> function—is not just a name, but also comes with a function rank. The function rank is set by the assignment <code><span class='Value'>f</span> <span class='Function'>=</span><span class='Head'>:</span> <span class='Value'>g</span></code>, and doesn't change along with <code><span class='Value'>g</span></code>. Calling <code><span class='Value'>f</span></code> doesn't rely on the rank, but <code><span class='String'>@</span></code> does, so <code><span class='Function'>&lt;</span><span class='String'>@</span><span class='Value'>f</span></code> effectively becomes <code><span class='Function'>&lt;</span><span class='String'>@</span><span class='Function'>|</span><span class='Value'>.</span><span class='String'>&quot;</span><span class='Function'>-</span></code>, mixing the two versions of <code><span class='Value'>g</span></code>. The only explanation I have for this one is implementation convenience.</p>
