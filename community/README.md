# BQN community links

Yes, BQN has users! Forums where we discuss things are linked [on the main page](../README.md#where-can-i-find-bqn-users), and there are a few projects elsewhere as well.

* Github repositories [tagged BQN](https://github.com/topics/bqn)
* [bqn-rest](https://codeberg.org/ndrogers/bqn-rest), for web APIs

You can also see BQN submissions on some sites that encourage shorter-form programming with the links below:

* [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:BQN) (consider translating [APL versions](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:APL)?)
* Stack Exchange [Code Golf & Coding Challenges](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/search?tab=newest&q=BQN)
