# Fill elements

A few array operations need an array element to use when no existing element applies. BQN tries to maintain a "default" element for every array, known as a fill element, for this purpose. If it's known, the fill element is a nested array structure where each atom is either `0` or `' '`. If no fill is known, a function that requests it results in an error.

Fills are used by [Take](take.md) (`↑`) when a value in `𝕨` is larger than the corresponding length in `𝕩`, by the two [Nudge](shift.md) functions (`»«`) when `𝕩` is non-empty, by [Merge](couple.md) (`>`) when `𝕩` is empty, and by [Reshape](reshape.md) (`⥊`) when `𝕨` contains `↑`. Except for these specific cases, the fill value an array has can't affect the program. The result of [Match](match.md) (`≡`) doesn't depend on fills, and any attempt to compute a fill can't cause side effects.

## Using fills

For the examples in this section we'll use the fact that an all-number array usually has `0` as a fill while a string has `' '` (BQN maintains fills alongside array values rather than deriving them from arrays, so it's possible to construct arrays where this isn't true, but this probably wouldn't happen in ordinary code).

[Take](take.md) (`↑`) and [Nudge](shift.md) (`»«`) in either direction use the fill for padding, to extend the array past its boundary. For example, `𝕨↑𝕩` will add elements to one side when a number in `|𝕨` is larger than the corresponding length in `≢𝕩`.

        ¯7 ↑ 4⥊3     # Fill with 0

        ¯7 ↑ "qrst"  # Fill with space

Nudge Left or Right shifts the array over and places a fill in the vacated space, effectively extending it backwards by one. If `𝕩` is empty then it shouldn't give an error, but it's safer not to rely on this.

        »¨ ⟨4⥊3,"qrst"⟩

        3↑⟨⟩  # Fill unknown

        »⟨⟩   # Fill not needed

If the argument to [Merge](couple.md) is empty then its result will be as well, since the shape `≢𝕩` is a prefix of `≢>𝕩`. However, the remainder of the result shape is determined by the elements of `𝕩`, so if there are none then Merge uses the fill element to decide what the result shape should be.

[Reshape](reshape.md#computed-lengths) (`⥊`) uses the fill when `𝕨` contains `↑` and the product of the rest of `𝕨` doesn't evenly divide the number of elements in `𝕩`.

If for some reason you need to find an array's fill element, the easiest general way is probably `⊑»1↑⥊a`.

## How fills are computed

For the exact requirements placed on fill, see [the specification](../spec/inferred.md#fill-elements) (particularly "required functions"). This section loosely describes behavior in existing BQN implementations, and includes some parts that aren't required in the specification.

A fill element should encompass something that's necessarily true for all elements of an array. If the way an array is computed implies it's all numbers, the fill should be `0`. If every element is a list of two numbers, then the fill should be `⟨0,0⟩`. If every element is a list but the lengths might vary, `⟨⟩` is probably a reasonable fill element.

For [arithmetic](arithmetic.md) primitives, the fill is found by the rules of pervasion, applying the function to both argument fills. Generally this means it consists of `0`, but character arithmetic also allows space fills.

[Mapping](map.md) modifiers Each and Table (`¨⌜`) might try to follow a similar strategy, applying `𝔽` to argument fills to obtain the result fill. The absolute rule here is that this computation cannot cause side effects or an error, so for a complicated `𝔽` such as a block function this procedure is likely to be aborted to avoid disrupting the rest of the program.

Most other primitives fit in one of three broad categories as shown in the table below. Structural primitives, indicated by `⊢`, don't change the fill of `𝕩`. Combining structural primitives, indicated by `∩`, only depend on the fill of all combined arrays—elements of `𝕩` in the one-argument case, or `𝕨` and `𝕩` in the two-argument case. Finally, many functions such as [search functions](search.md) return only numbers and have a fill of `0`.

| Fill   | Monads       | Dyads       | Modifiers
|--------|--------------|-------------|----------
| `⊢`    | `∧∨⥊≍»«⌽⍉⊏⍷` | `⥊↑↓↕⌽⍉/⊏`  | `` 𝔽` ``
| `∩`    | `>∾`         | `∾≍»«`
| `0`    | `≢/⍋⍒∊⊐⊒`    | `⍋⍒⊐⊒∊⍷`

Besides these, there are a few primitives with special fills. [Enclose](enclose.md) (`<`) uses a fill derived directly from `𝕩`, with all numbers replaced by `0` and characters by `' '` (if it contains non-data atoms, the fill doesn't exist). [Range](range.md) (`↕`) does the same, although the reason is less obvious: the result elements don't match `𝕩`, but they have the same structure.

[Prefixes and Suffixes](prefixes.md) (`↑↓`) use `0↑𝕩` for the fill, as do [Group](group.md) and Group Indices (`⊔`) in the single-axis case. Fills for multi-axis `⊔` are more complicated, but follow the rule that variable-length axes are changed to length 0. The *elements* of the result of `⊔` also have a fill specified: the same as `𝕩` for Group, or `0` for Group Indices.
