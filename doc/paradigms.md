# BQN in programming paradigms

It hangs onto weakly positive connotations somehow, but the term "multi-paradigm" should not really impress you. Let's dig into exactly which paradigms BQN supports and how.

This information won't really tell you what tasks BQN is good for: after all, it turns out you can write a compiler entirely using array programming, something many people assumed was impossible. Instead, it tells you what approaches you can take to writing programs, and how comfortable you'll find it to work with BQNâ€”or how much you can use it to stretch your brain in new directions.

BQN is not great for **imperative** programming.

imperative in which the programmer instructs the machine how to change its state,
  procedural which groups instructions into procedures,
  object-oriented which groups instructions with the part of the state they operate on,

declarative in which the programmer merely declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it
  functional in which the desired result is declared as the value of a series of function applications,
  logic or reactive

macros or reflection
