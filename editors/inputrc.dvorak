# Dvorak BQN keybindings for Readline configuration file .inputrc
# Enables BQN combinations in bash and rlwrap (used by dzaima/BQN REPL)

# Readline bindings are recursive, so use this trick to turn double
# backslash into an actual backslash character.
# Assuming ctrl-x esc isn't bound, the part after \\ does nothing,
# except keep Readline from waiting for a backslash combination.
