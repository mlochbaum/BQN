INTRODUCTION                                    *bqn*

This plugin provides syntax highlighting and a keymap
for the BQN programming language. For more information
about the language, see
https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/

This plugin also has descriptions of BQN characters:
press F1 to toggle a status line that describes the
one under the cursor. While it tries to adjust vim's
word boundary behavior to match BQN, characters ˜˘˝
can't be configured and still incorrectly behave as
word characters.

KEYMAP                                          *bqn-keymap*

The plugin sets the following keymap when editing BQN
files, such that the upper symbol is <Leader><key> and
the lower symbol is <Leader><Shift-key>. The leader
key defaults to \ and can changed by setting
g:bqn_prefix_key before loading the keymap.
