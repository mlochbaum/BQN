# BQN specification

This directory gives a specification for BQN. The specification differs from the [documentation](../doc/README.md) in that its purpose is only to describe the exact details of BQN's operation in the most quickly accessible way, rather than to explain the core ideas of BQN functionality and how it might be used.

The core of BQN, which excludes system-provided values, is now completely specified, although the spec will continue to be edited further to improve clarity and cover edge cases that were missed initially.

The BQN specification consists of the following documents:
- [Types](types.md)
- [Token formation](token.md)
- [Literals](literal.md)
- [Grammar](grammar.md)
- [Variable scoping](scope.md)
- [Evaluation semantics](evaluate.md)
- [Primitives](primitive.md): [reference implementations](reference.bqn)
- [Inferred properties](inferred.md) (identities, fills, Undo, and Under)
- [System-provided values](system.md) (`â€¢`)
