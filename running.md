# How to run BQN

[CBQN](https://github.com/dzaima/CBQN) is now the primary offline implementation. However, dzaima/BQN still works, and is used for some testing. Scripts in this repository use `bqn` in the `#!` line if any BQN can run them, and `dbqn` if only dzaima/BQN works.

For Nix users, nixpkgs now has repositories for several implementations; `cbqn` is recommended for general use.

### Self-hosted BQN

See the subsections below for instructions on specific implementations.

This version of BQN is [implemented](implementation/README.md) mainly in BQN itself, but a host language supplies basic functionality and can also replace primitives for better performance. This also allows [embedding](doc/embed.md), where programs in the host language can include BQN code. It fully supports all primitives except a few cases of structural Under (`⌾`), and is missing some minor syntax features such as derived 1-modifiers and block returns.

Support in the following languages has been implemented:
- Javascript, in this repository. Slow (compiles at ~5kB/s) but usable.
- [C](https://github.com/dzaima/CBQN), targetting high performance. Some parts are fast, some are not.
- dzaima/BQN ([bqn.bqn](bqn.bqn)), mainly for testing.
- [Erlang](https://github.com/cannadayr/ebqn), intended for embedding. Too slow to be practical; a [Rust version](https://github.com/cannadayr/ebqn-rs/) is in progress to fix this.

#### Javascript

The online REPL is [here](https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/try.html). The file [docs/bqn.js](docs/bqn.js) is zero-dependency Javascript, and can be loaded from HTML or Node.js. For command line use, call the Node.js script [bqn.js](bqn.js), passing a file and `•args`, or `-e` to execute all remaining arguments directly and print the results. [This notebook](https://observablehq.com/@lsh/bqn) shows how to run it in an Observable notebook.

#### CBQN

C sources are kept in the [CBQN](https://github.com/dzaima/CBQN) repository, but it also depends on bytecode from the BQN sources here. Running `make` gets a working copy right away with saved bytecode. Then to use the latest bytecode, call `$ ./BQN genRuntime …/BQN`, where `…/BQN` points to this repository, and run `make` again.

`genRuntime` can also be run with another BQN implementation (the Node.js one works but takes up to a minute), and plain `./genRuntime` uses your system's `bqn` executable. I symlink `…/CBQN/BQN` to `~/bin/bqn` so I can easily use CBQN for scripting.

CBQN uses the self-hosted runtime to achieve full primitive coverage, and implements specific primitives or parts of primitives natively to speed them up. This means primitives with native support—including everything used by the compiler—are fairly fast while others are much slower.

### dzaima/BQN

[dzaima/BQN](https://github.com/dzaima/BQN/) is an implementation in Java created by modifying the existing dzaima/APL, and should be easy to run on desktop Linux and Android. It may be abandoned as dzaima is now working on CBQN. It has almost complete syntax support but incomplete primitive support: major missing functionality is dyadic Depth (`⚇`), Windows (`↕`), and many cases of set functions (`⊐⊒∊⍷`, mostly with rank >1).

In this repository and elsewhere, dzaima/BQN scripts are called with `#! /usr/bin/env dbqn`. This requires an executable file `dbqn` somewhere in your path with the following contents:

    #! /bin/bash

    java -jar /path/to/dzaima/BQN/BQN.jar "$@"

If compiled with Native Image, `nBQN` can be used directly instead.

#### dzaima+reference BQN

This repository contains a dzaima/BQN script `dzref` that fills in gaps in primitive support with BQN implementations. It was used for md.bqn for a while and is no longer used now. The command-line arguments are a script to run and followed by the `•args` to supply to it.

### BQN2NGN

[BQN2NGN](https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN2NGN) is a prototype implementation in Javascript build to experiment with the langauge, which is now abandoned.
