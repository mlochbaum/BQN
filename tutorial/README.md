# BQN tutorials

BQN tutorials explain how to approach and use the language as a newcomer (or they try; please get in touch if you find that they skip ahead!). Tutorials are meant to explain key ideas and may ignore details that would be included in the [documentation](../doc/README.md); also unlike the documentation they're meant to be read in order, as each tutorial will build on ideas from the previous ones.

Tutorials assume (pretty presumptively, really. Disgusting.) that you are already motivated to learn BQN and use simple rather than flashy examples. Documents to induce motivation beyond the README are not yet available. Do feel free to skim or jump around if you find you are reading a lot of things that are already obvious.

The tutorials available so far:
- [Expressions](expression.md)
- [List manipulation](list.md)
