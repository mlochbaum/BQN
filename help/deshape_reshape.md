## `𝕨 ⥊ 𝕩`: Reshape
[→full documentation](../doc/reshape.md)

Put all elements of `𝕩` in an array of shape `𝕨`, removing elements or repeating them cyclically if necessary.

A single element in `𝕨` can be a function, which will be replaced with an appropriate length:
- `∘` Exact fit
- `⌊` Round length down, discarding elements
- `⌽` Round length up
- `↑` Round length up, and use element fill to add extra elements.
