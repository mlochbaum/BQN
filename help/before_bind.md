# Multimap (`⊸`)
    
## `𝕗⊸𝔾 𝕩`: Bind Left
    
Supply `𝕗` as a left argument to `𝔾` (`𝕗 𝔾 𝕩`).
    
`𝕗` is a constant, `𝔾` must be dyadic.
    
           3⊸- 9

           3 - 9

    
    
## `𝔽⊸𝔾 𝕩`: Before
    
Apply `𝔽` to `𝕩`, and supply it as a left argument to `𝔾` (`(𝔽 𝕩) 𝔾 𝕩`). 
    
`𝔽` must be monadic, `𝔾` must be dyadic.
    
           -⊸+ 9

           - + 9

           (- 9) + 9

    
    
## `𝕨 𝔽⊸𝔾 𝕩`: Dyadic Before
    
Apply `𝔽` to `𝕨`, and supply it as a left argument to `𝔾` (`(𝔽 𝕨) 𝔾 𝕩`).
    
`𝔽` must be monadic, `𝔾` must be dyadic.
