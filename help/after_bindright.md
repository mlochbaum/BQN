# Left Multimap (`⟜`)
    
## `𝔽⟜𝕘 𝕩`: Bind 
    
Supply `𝕘` as a right argument to `𝔽` (`𝕩 𝔽 𝕘`).
    
## `𝕘` must be a value, `F` must be dyadic.
    
           -⟜3 9

           - 3 9

           9 - 3

    
    
## `𝔽⟜𝔾 𝕩`: After
    
Apply `𝔾` to `𝕩`, and supply it as a right argument to `𝔽` (`𝕩 𝔽 (𝔾 𝕩)`). 
    
## `𝔽` must be dyadic, `𝔾` must be monadic.
    
           ×⟜- 9

           × - 9
