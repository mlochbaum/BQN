# Implementation of arithmetic

The dyadic arithmetic functions are `+-√ó√∑‚ãÜ‚àö‚åä‚åà|¬¨‚àß‚à®<>‚â†=‚â§‚â•`. There are also monadic arithmetic functions, but they're mostly easy to optimize.

## Boolean functions

Many arithmetic functions give boolean results when both arguments are boolean. Because there are only 16 possible functions like this, they overlap a lot. Here's a categorization:

        f ‚Üê ‚àß‚Äø‚à®‚Äø<‚Äø>‚Äø‚â†‚Äø=‚Äø‚â§‚Äø‚â•‚Äø+‚Äø-‚Äø√ó‚Äø√∑‚Äø‚ãÜ‚Äø‚àö‚Äø‚åä‚Äø‚åà‚Äø|‚Äø¬¨

        bt ‚Üê {‚•äùïè‚åúÀú‚Üï2}¬®f
        ‚àß‚åæ(‚åΩ¬®‚åæ(‚äèÀò)) bt (‚ç∑‚àò‚ä£‚âçÀò‚äê‚ä∏‚äî)‚óã((‚àß¬¥‚àò‚àä‚üú(‚Üï2)¬®bt)‚ä∏/) f

Some functions have fast implementations when one argument is boolean. The only ones that really matter are `√ó`/`‚àß`, which can be implemented with a bitmask, and `‚à®`, which changes the other argument to 1 when the boolean argument is 1 and otherwise leaves it alone. `‚ãÜ` is `‚à®‚üú¬¨` when `ùï©` is boolean.

A function of an atom and a boolean array, or a monadic function on a boolean array, can be implemented by a lookup performed with (preferably SIMD) bitmasking.

## Strength reductions

### Trivial cases

Several cases where either one argument is an atom, or both arguments match, have a trivial result. Either the result value is constant, or it matches the argument.

| Constant   | Constant  |  Identity
|------------|-----------|-----------
|            |           | `a+0`
| `a-a`      |           | `a-0`
| `a¬¨a`      |           | `a¬¨1`
|            | `a√ó0`\*   | `a√ó1`
|            | `a‚à®1`     | `a‚à®0`
| `a√∑a`\*    | `0√∑a`\*   | `a√∑1`
|            | `a‚ãÜ0`     | `a‚ãÜ1`
|            |           | `¬Ø‚àû‚åäa`, `‚àû‚åàn`
| `a>a` etc. |           | `a‚åäa`, `a‚åàa`

None of the constant column entries work for NaNs, except `a‚ãÜ0` which really is always 1. Starred entries have some values of `a` that result in NaN instead of the expected constant: `0` for division and `‚àû` for multiplication. This means that constant-result `√∑` always requires checking for NaN while the other entries work for integers without a check.

### Division and modulus

Division, integer division, and Modulus by an atom (`a√∑n`, `a‚åä‚àò√∑n`, `n|a`) are subject to many optimizations.

- Floating-point with FMA: [this page](http://marc-b-reynolds.github.io/math/2019/03/12/FpDiv.html) gives a slightly slower method that works for all divisors and a faster one that can be proven to work on over half of divisors.
- Integer division: see [libdivide](https://github.com/ridiculousfish/libdivide). Most important is a mask for power-of-two `n`. For smaller integer types, using SIMD code with 32-bit floats is also fast.
