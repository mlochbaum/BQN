# Implementation of arithmetic

The dyadic arithmetic functions are `+-√ó√∑‚ãÜ‚àö‚åä‚åà|¬¨‚àß‚à®<>‚â†=‚â§‚â•`. There are also monadic arithmetic functions, but they're mostly easy to optimize.

## Boolean functions

Many arithmetic functions give boolean results when both arguments are boolean. Because there are only 16 possible functions like this, they overlap a lot. Here's a categorization:

        f ‚Üê ‚àß‚Äø‚à®‚Äø<‚Äø>‚Äø‚â†‚Äø=‚Äø‚â§‚Äø‚â•‚Äø+‚Äø-‚Äø√ó‚Äø√∑‚Äø‚ãÜ‚Äø‚àö‚Äø‚åä‚Äø‚åà‚Äø|‚Äø¬¨

        bt ‚Üê {‚•äùïè‚åúÀú‚Üï2}¬®f
        ‚àß‚åæ(‚åΩ¬®‚åæ(‚äèÀò)) bt (‚ç∑‚àò‚ä£‚âçÀò‚äê‚ä∏‚äî)‚óã((‚àß¬¥‚àò‚àä‚üú(‚Üï2)¬®bt)‚ä∏/) f

Some functions have fast implementations when one argument is boolean. The only ones that really matter are `√ó`/`‚àß`, which can be implemented with a bitmask, and `‚à®`, which changes the other argument to 1 when the boolean argument is 1 and otherwise leaves it alone. `‚ãÜ` is `‚à®‚üú¬¨` when `ùï©` is boolean.

A function of an atom and a boolean array, or a monadic function on a boolean array, can be implemented by a lookup performed with (preferably SIMD) bitmasking.

## Strength reductions

### Trivial cases

Several cases where either one argument is an atom, or both arguments match, have a trivial result. Either the result value is constant, or it matches the argument.

| Constant   | Constant     |  Identity
|------------|--------------|-----------
|            |              | `a+0`
| `a-a`      |              | `a-0`
| `a¬¨a`      |              | `a¬¨1`
|            | `a√ó0`\*      | `a√ó1`
|            | `a‚à®1`        | `a‚à®0`
| `a√∑a`\*    | `0√∑a`\*      | `a√∑1`
|            | `a‚ãÜ0`, `1‚ãÜa` | `a‚ãÜ1`
|            |              | `¬Ø‚àû‚åäa`, `‚àû‚åàn`
| `a>a` etc. |              | `a‚åäa`, `a‚åàa`

None of the constant column entries work for NaNs, except `a‚ãÜ0` and `1‚ãÜa` which really are always 1. Starred entries have some values of `a` that result in NaN instead of the expected constant: `0` for division and `‚àû` for multiplication. This means that constant-result `√∑` always requires checking for NaN while the other entries work for integers without a check.

### Division and modulus

Division, integer division, and Modulus by an atom (`a√∑n`, `a‚åä‚àò√∑n`, `n|a`) are subject to many optimizations.

- Floating-point with FMA: [this page](http://marc-b-reynolds.github.io/math/2019/03/12/FpDiv.html) gives a slightly slower method that works for all divisors and a faster one that can be proven to work on over half of divisors.
- Integer division: see [libdivide](https://github.com/ridiculousfish/libdivide). Most important is a mask for power-of-two `n`. For smaller integer types, using SIMD code with 32-bit floats is also fast: see below.

#### Integer division with floats

If `p` and `q` are integers and `p` is small enough, then the floor division `‚åäp√∑q` gives an exact result. This isn't always the case for floats: for example `1 ‚åä‚àò√∑ (√∑9)+1e¬Ø17` rounds up to 9 when an exact floor-divide would round down to 8. It means that `q|p` is exactly `p-q√ó‚åäp√∑q`, a faster computation.

In particular, if `p` is a 16-bit or smaller integer and `q` is any integer, then the floor division `‚åäp√∑q` and modulus `q|p` can be computed exactly in single (32-bit float) precision. If `p` is a 32-bit integer these can be computed exactly in double precision.

We will prove the case with 32-bit `p` in double precision. If `q` is large, say it has absolute value greater than `2‚ãÜ32`, then `(|p√∑q)<1`, meaning the correct result is `¬Ø1` if it's negative and `0` otherwise. If `p` is nonzero, then `(|p√∑q) > |√∑q`, which is greater than the smallest subnormal for any `q`, and so the division won't round up to 0. So suppose `q` is small. If `p` is a multiple of `q`, say `p=k√óq`, then `k‚â§‚óã|p` so `k` is exactly representable as a double and the division is exact. If `p` is not an exact multiple, say `p=(k√óq)-o` with nonzero `o<q`, then write it as `k√ó(q-o√∑k)` and the quotient is `k√ó1-o√∑k√óq`, or `k√ó1-o√∑p+o`. For this number to round up to `k` it would have to be larger than `k√ó1-√∑2‚ãÜ52`, but `p+o` is less than `p+q` which is much less than `2‚ãÜ52`, so the rounded division result is less than `k`, giving a floor of `k-1`.
